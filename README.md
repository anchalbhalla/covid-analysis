## Description 
Navigating our new world in this time of crisis is not easy. Healthcare and emergency organizations need to be aware of the current situation for 2 main reason: 
1. Planning out healthcare and other supplies by forecasting the trend and take the necessary actions as precautions.
2. Be more aware of the situation in the country plus globally to track critical countries and times.

The project aims to solve the following <strong>business problems</strong>: 
1. What's next? A pandemic as such usually leaves governments and healthcare officials confused as to what would be the effect of this and is going to happen in the future. 
2. Future planning - Organizations need to plan out the necessary precautions by looking at the current situation and the predicted situation.

The COVID analyzer project aims to ease the task of these critical organisations so authories can focus more on planning and treatments. It uses data from all across the globe to visualize the current situation in a very interactive manner using <strong>Cognos Dashboards</strong> which gives them the customization option as well. Next, <strong>AI models</strong> have been deployed to a <strong>shiny application</strong> which show the forecast of the coronavirus spread in critial countries - UAE, Italy and China. These models have been created using <strong>SPSS</strong> to show the quick, efficient and accurate methods on Watson Studio.
